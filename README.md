## Interactive visualizations of results on hu.MAP 1.0:
To investigate the complexes identified by the RL algorithm interactively, visualizations are available for the 1157 learned complexes here for:
[All Learned Complexes](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Complex2proteins.html
)

[All Learned Complexes, sortable by protein annotation scores](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Complex2proteins_annotated.html)

[All Learned Complexes, sorted by number of SARS-CoV-2 interacting hu.MAP 1.0 proteins](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Complex2proteins_covid.html)

[hu.MAP 1.0 proteins and their corresponding learned protein complexes](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Protein2complex.html)

We also sorted hu.MAP 1.0 proteins by their annotation scores, and indicate the learned complexes each protein is a member of, here:
[hu.MAP 1.0 proteins and their corresponding protein complexes, sorted in ascending  annotation score order](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Protein2complex_annotated.html)

We also make available a list of protein complexes that contain proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins here:
[SARS-CoV-2 interacting hu.MAP 1.0 proteins and their corresponding protein complexes](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Protein2complex_covid.html)

Similarly, sorted in ascending order of annotation score here: 
[SARS-CoV-2 interacting hu.MAP 1.0 proteins and their corresponding protein complexes, sorted in ascending annotation score order](https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Protein2complex_annotated_covid.html)

Complexes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be visualized by exploring different complexes from Complex 1 to Complex 1157 by changing the last part of the URL in: https://marcottelab.github.io/RL_humap_prediction/humap/Predicted_Cov/Complex1.html
